<p><h1>F.Scott Fitzgerald Stamp Series</h1>
I created this set of stamps celebrating fiction writing and particularly the work of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Mostly known for his novel "The Great Gatsby" , Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald was an American author of novels and short stories, whose works are the paradigmatic writings of the Jazz Age.I focused on four major themes he writes about throughout all of his work; betrayal, greed, escape, and regret. Though Fitzgerald died believing he was a failure as a writer, it wasn't until after his death his work began to be praised eventually making him one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century..</p>
